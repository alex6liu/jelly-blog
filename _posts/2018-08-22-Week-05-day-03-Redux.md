## Redux
[redux](https://redux.js.org/)
![](https://alex6liu.github.io/assert/redux.png)

### Three Principles

#### Single source of truth
The state of your whole application is stored in an object tree within a single store.

#### State is read-only
The only way to change the state is to emit an action, an object describing what happened.

#### Changes are made with pure functions
To specify how the state tree is transformed by actions, you write pure reducers.

## actions
[Actions](https://redux.js.org/basics/actions) are payloads of information that send data from your application to your store. They are the only source of information for the store. You send them to the store using ```store.dispatch()```.

Actions look like this:
```
{ type: 'ADD_TODO', text: 'Use Redux' }
{ type: 'REMOVE_TODO', id: 42 }
{ type: 'LOAD_ARTICLE', response: { ... } }
```

### Action Creators
You might write an action creator in a separate file, and import it into your component:

```
// actionCreators.js
export function addTodo(text) {
  return {
    type: 'ADD_TODO',
    text
  }
}
```
```
// AddTodo.js
import { addTodo } from './actionCreators'
​
// somewhere in an event handler
dispatch(addTodo('Use Redux'))
```

### Source Code
```
// actions.js
/*
 * action types
 */
​
export const ADD_TODO = 'ADD_TODO'
export const TOGGLE_TODO = 'TOGGLE_TODO'
export const SET_VISIBILITY_FILTER = 'SET_VISIBILITY_FILTER'
​
/*
 * other constants
 */
​
export const VisibilityFilters = {
  SHOW_ALL: 'SHOW_ALL',
  SHOW_COMPLETED: 'SHOW_COMPLETED',
  SHOW_ACTIVE: 'SHOW_ACTIVE'
}
​
/*
 * action creators
 */
​
export function addTodo(text) {
  return { type: ADD_TODO, text }
}
​
export function toggleTodo(index) {
  return { type: TOGGLE_TODO, index }
}
​
export function setVisibilityFilter(filter) {
  return { type: SET_VISIBILITY_FILTER, filter }
}
```

## reduers
[Reducers](https://redux.js.org/basics/reducers) specify how the application's state changes in response to actions sent to the store. Remember that actions only describe what happened, but don't describe how the application's state changes.

### Designing the State Shape
In Redux, all the application state is stored as a single object.

You'll often find that you need to store some data, as well as some UI state, in the state tree. This is fine, but try to keep the data separate from the UI state.

### Handling Actions
For now, just remember that the reducer must be pure. Given the same arguments, it should calculate the next state and return it. No surprises. **No side effects. No API calls. No mutations. Just a calculation**.

Note that:

We don't mutate the ```state```. We create a copy with ```Object.assign()```. ```Object.assign(state, { visibilityFilter: action.filter })``` is also wrong: it will mutate the first argument. You must supply an empty object as the first parameter. You can also enable the object spread operator proposal to write ```{ ...state, ...newState }``` instead.

We return the previous ```state``` in the ```default``` case. It's important to return the previous ```state``` for any unknown action.

###Source Code
```
// reducers.js
import { combineReducers } from 'redux'
import {
  ADD_TODO,
  TOGGLE_TODO,
  SET_VISIBILITY_FILTER,
  VisibilityFilters
} from './actions'
const { SHOW_ALL } = VisibilityFilters
​
function visibilityFilter(state = SHOW_ALL, action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case SET_VISIBILITY_FILTER:
      return action.filter
    default:
      return state
  }
}
​
function todos(state = [], action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case ADD_TODO:
      return [
        ...state,
        {
          text: action.text,
          completed: false
        }
      ]
    case TOGGLE_TODO:
      return state.map((todo, index) => {
        if (index === action.index) {
          return Object.assign({}, todo, {
            completed: !todo.completed
          })
        }
        return todo
      })
    default:
      return state
  }
}
​
const todoApp = combineReducers({
  visibilityFilter,
  todos
})
​
export default todoApp
```

## store
The [Store](https://redux.js.org/basics/store) is the object that brings them together. The store has the following responsibilities:

- Holds application state;

- Allows access to state via getState();

- Allows state to be updated via dispatch(action);

- Registers listeners via subscribe(listener);

- Handles unregistering of listeners via the function returned by subscribe(listener).

### Source Code
```
// index.js
import { createStore } from 'redux'
import todoApp from './reducers'
​
const store = createStore(todoApp)
```

## data flow
Redux architecture revolves around a **strict unidirectional [data flow](https://redux.js.org/basics/dataflow)**.

This means that all data in an application follows the same lifecycle pattern, making the logic of your app more predictable and easier to understand. It also encourages data normalization, so that you don't end up with multiple, independent copies of the same data that are unaware of one another.

The data lifecycle in any Redux app follows these 4 steps:

1. You call store.dispatch(action).
2. The Redux store calls the reducer function you gave it.
3. The root reducer may combine the output of multiple reducers into a single state tree.
4. The Redux store saves the complete state tree returned by the root reducer.
